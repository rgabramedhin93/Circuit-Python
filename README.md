## HelloArduino

### Description & Code
This is the code of my Arduino LED blinking. When I put Serial.begin that means it turns on the the Serial Monitor. Then Serial Print Line means each line it is gonna say "Hello World" and this is for the void setup. For the void loop I put down Serial Print without the line which means it will print "Blink" beside each other instead of line by line.
```C++
